# Welcome to `pathint`'s documentation!

`pathint` is a jax implementation of the [path integral sampler](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.15141),
a method based on the Schr√∂dinger bridge problem for sampling from (unnormalized)
probability densities. Behind the scenes it relies on [diffrax](https://github.com/patrick-kidger/diffrax)
to handle the stochastic differential equations, [equinox](https://github.com/patrick-kidger/equinox)
for the neural networks and [optax](https://github.com/deepmind/optax/) for training.
